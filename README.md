This is my first time trying to work with GSAP on a javascript page. 
It was not that easy getting it done but will continue trying to get it to work
I learnt about the fromTo('className', {old property: old method}, {new property:new method});
fromTo -> where it starts from and where it is going to.
className -> name of property that needs to be animated.
old property -> name of property to be updated.
new property -> name of updated property.
